<!--
Templates in Flask are used to create reusable HTML layouts that can be used across multiple pages in a web application. The idea is to separate the presentation logic (i.e., how the page looks) from the application logic (i.e., how the page works).

In Flask, templates are typically written in HTML and can include placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., data from a database, user input, etc.). Flask uses a templating engine (Jinja2) to render these templates and fill in the placeholders with actual data.

Templates in Flask can also include control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals, etc.) and macros (i.e., reusable code snippets) to make it easier to create complex layouts.

By using templates in Flask, you can create a consistent look and feel across your web application and make it easier to maintain and update your code.
